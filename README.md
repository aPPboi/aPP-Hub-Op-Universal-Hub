# aPP-Hub-Op-Universal-Hub
Welcome to aPO Uni-Hub!
a = aPP 
P = Paragon
O = OP
Uni = Universal
Hub = Well, you know, Hub of course!

This GUI is OP in my opinion (Not because I created it, but because it has a variety of scripts and guis that you can load.)
This OP masterpiece has alot of games to choose from to exploit in!
We have the most undetectable scripts. (DO NOT USE MURDER MYSTERY 2, OR YOU CAN GET BANNED FROM ROBLOX OR MM2 ITSELF.)
Supports -
Zeus
Synapse X
Sentinel
KRNL
And much more!
Unsupported -
JJSploit
Vega X (Some scripts)
PandaBird XZ (Most of the scripts)

Why dont we support these executors -
Well, it isn't really us that caused this, really what it is, is that there are levels that these scripts run in and if the level is too high for, and the executor will
crash.
Here is our level range:
Levels 7-100 (There is only one executor that has hit level 100, but I cant tell you, it's a secret.
Zeus - Level 12 (✅)
Synapse X - Level 11 (✅)
Sentinel - Level 11 (✅)
KRNL - Level 9 (✅)
Coco Z - Level 7 (✅)
JJSploit - Level 3 (❌)
Vega X - Levels 6-7 (🤷)
PandaBird XZ Levels 4-6 ( Half of 🤷 half of ❌)

Copyright Ownership © aPO LuaC+ Company ® 1995-2023 (Not a real company but I kind of had a talent so I decided to make my personal company)
A little bit of info about the me, the owner of this personal company,

In 1994, a year before aPO LuaC+ Company ® came out,
I was only 5 months old and I had a very inhuman talent of typing at 67 WPM and already programming in Lua®.
Once I turned a year old, I was already making scripts for video games, and then my mother told me I should make a personal company, so I did.
A decade later in 2005 at eleven, I had made a kid's world typing record of 119 WPM beating 12 year old Ji Dion's world record of 115 WPM, and my Lua programming was so
crazy, that Lua ® offered me a scholarship, but I wrote back to them, "I may be good, but Lua, I have alot to learn before I go to college, I am only in 6th grade."
Once I turned 16, I was already able to go to college, so once again, I got another scholarship offer a few days before Graduation, I signed it, excited that I would
finally become famous! >>Fast Foward to the day of the graduation<< I told the crowd that I want to be a Lua Programmer, all of a sudden the crowd went silent with their jaws dropped,
but I couldn't tell if they were dissapointed or completely shocked that I am about to become a big part of the world! About ten seconds later, the crowd roared in 
cheers, they were repeadetly chanting, "NO-AH", "NO-AH", and I walked off the stage once my turn was done, and they weren't paying any of the other next eighteen year
old adults any mind, not even the parents! They still were chanting my name! I went home, and my parents setup a whole cake and presents, with all of my family there!
As if it were; A birthday party! >>Fast foward to me now at 28<< To this day, as I am typing to ya'll right now, I am so blessed to be the first five month old to
type at 70 WPM and being able to program in Lua ®. Now I am doing well and just finished doing aPP's script, and I have finally beat Barbara Blackburn's record, she
got 212 WPM as her maximum, while I just hit 270 WPM.
